This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programming involving the REDEFINES clause.  Improper use of REDEFINES can lead to data corruption and unexpected program behavior. The bug.cob file shows the erroneous code, while bugSolution.cob provides the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of careful data structure management in COBOL to avoid subtle but potentially damaging bugs.
